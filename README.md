## Project Structure

- **HTML (`index.html`):** Defines the webpage structure.
- **CSS (`css/styles.css`):** Provides styles for a clean and visually appealing layout.
- **JavaScript (`js/script.js`):** Implements the countdown timer functionality.

## Usage

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the countdown timer.

## Functionality

The JavaScript code calculates the time difference between the target date (March 3, 2024) and the current date, displaying the remaining days and milliseconds. If the target date has passed, the display shows "Expired."
